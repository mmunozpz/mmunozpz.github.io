MSc Student in Machine Learning for Health (UC3M)<br>Researcher at Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón

## About

I am a Biomedical Engineer currently working as a researcher in the Cardiology Department at Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM), where my main research focus is ECG-based arrhythmia detection. I also provide technical support in catheter ablation studies and am currently involved in several clinical trials.

In parallel, I am completing my Master’s degree in Machine Learning for Health at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M).

I have previous research experience at Georgia Institute of Technology and Purdue University, including work on cardiopulmonary signal analysis for egophony detection at the Inan Research Lab, as well as research applying deep learning techniques to structural biology in the Jiang Lab.

## Current areas of research

- Arrhythmia detection
- Machine and deep learning
- Biomedical signal processing
